> ./bin/VideoStablization -f input_file_path [-salient 0.9] [-crop 0.1] [-pathsmooth 20] [-facesmooth 5]

default value: 
sallient = 0 //not use face feature
hcrop =0.1 //crop 10% of wide and height on both edge
pathsmooth=20 //radius for smoothing trajectory.
facesmooth=5 //radius for smoothing face feature to center
